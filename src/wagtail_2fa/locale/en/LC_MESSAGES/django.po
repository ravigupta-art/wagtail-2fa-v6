"                Two-Factor authentication is a method for making your "
"account\n"
"                more secure, by requiring you to provide an additional "
"piece\n"
"                of evidence (a factor) next to your password.\n"
"            </p>\n"
"            <p>\n"
"                The most common way of providing this secondary factor, is "
"by\n"
"                having one of your devices generate a random code that\n"
"                changes every minute. This is called a One Time Password.\n"
"            </p>\n"
"            <p>\n"
"                For generating codes, you can use one of the following "
"apps.\n"
"                You might even have them installed already.\n"
"                <ul>\n"
"                    <li>Google Authenticator for iOS or Android</li>\n"
"                    <li>Microsoft Authenticator</li>\n"
"                    <li>Authy for iOS or Android</li>\n"
"                    <li>\n"
"                        A password manager like 1Password, that also "
"supports\n"
"                        generating One-Time-Passwords\n"
"                    </li>\n"
"                </ul>\n"

"                account, install one of those apps and scan the below QR\n"
"                code. Note that if you lose or reset your phone, you\n"
